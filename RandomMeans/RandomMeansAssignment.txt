Random Means  40 points

You may work in pairs (or even trios or more) but all students must 
contribute "evenly" and understand all parts of the project.

Part 1
Write a program to do the following. Submit your code, sample output,
and a discussion.

A. Instantiate a histogram to hold integers in the range 1 to 20.
   Use the posted Histogram class.

B. Generate 3 random integers between 1 and 20. 

C. Calculate the average of the numbers generated in part B. 

D. Round the average to an int and submit it to the histogram.

E. Repeat steps B, C, and D 10,000 times.

F. Print the histogram. 
 

Part 2
Repeat part 1 except in step B generate 10 random numbers.


Part 3
Repeat part 2 except generate the random numners in such a way that
there ia a 50% chance that a number between 1 and 5 inclusive 
is generated, and a 50% chance that a number between 11 and 20
inclusive is generated.
